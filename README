## Installation Problems
When developing the code on the Jetson the camera logging works only executing the program with sudo privileges. Otherwise the execution fails with Segmentation Fault.
In order to avoid this behaviour run the following commands:
- update usb port privilegies:
    sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/bus/usb/

- when executing the command realsense-viewer in order to run the realsense user interface we noticed on the top right corner a pop up which indicated to update libusb realsense rules. To do it run the following command:
sudo cp ~/.99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-realsense-libusb.rules && sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
